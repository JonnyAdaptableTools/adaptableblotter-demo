            is fired as soon as AdapTable has completed its initialisation. It
            provides the `AdaptableReadyInfo` object which contains 2
            properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>adaptableAPI</b>: This is the AdaptableApi which provides run
              time access to all methods, functionality and events in AdapTable
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>vendorGrid</b>: This is the instance of the underlying vendor
              grid being used
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            'vendorGrid' is returned because AdapTable enriches the one it
            receives in AdaptableOptions (with modules & other properties), so
            use this object if you want access to the underlying grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: the React and Angular ag-Grid wrappers explicitly
            return 'adaptableApi and 'gridOptions' as the event arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example we have used Adaptable Ready to set the Quick Search
            Text (through Quick Search section of AdaptableAPI).{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            We also use it to hook up to the ag-grid Selection Changed event
            (logging the output below).
          </p>
