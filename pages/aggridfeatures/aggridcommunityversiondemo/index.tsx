          <p>
            This demo shows AdapTable using just the ag-Grid Community version
            (i.e. with <b>none</b> of the ag-Grid Enterprise features
            available.)
          </p>
          <p>
            When this is the case AdapTable will still work with the vast
            majority of its features enabled - e.g. Layout, Flashing Cells,
            Smart Edit, Calculated Column, FreeText Column etc. (as shown here)
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise all the advanced features AdapTable offers such as the
            No-Code version, Team Sharing, Audit Log, Query, Server Validation,
            Alerts, Schedules etc. are present.
          </p>{' '}
          <p>
            However, Modules which support advanced ag-Grid features only
            available in ag-Grid Enterprise Edition <b>are missing</b> e.g.
            support for Master / Detail or Tree Grids.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that as the normal ag-Grid Menu is missing (because it is an
            Enterprise) feature, AdapTable adds its own Column Header Menu -
            with support for user-defined menu items.
